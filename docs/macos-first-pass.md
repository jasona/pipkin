# macOS: experimental first pass

The `Experimental macOS build` GitHub Actions workflow builds the actual GPUI app on a macOS 15
runner. First observed green run: [37482847877](https://github.com/last-refuge/pipkin/actions/runs/37482847877),
clean app `f52e8c254488c4524c4cb986530eee7048b4f138`, **Apple Silicon/aarch64**. Intel/universal builds
have not been produced or qualified. Download the artifact identified by its app revision and runner architecture, unzip its
experimental app archive, and retain `build-info.json` and `SHA256SUMS`. This is a native single-
architecture build, **not** a universal binary, Developer ID-signed/notarized distribution or supported 1.0 release.
Do not treat a checksum as publisher authentication.

## Downloaded-bundle signature qualification

The first f52e8c2/ba836a7 artifacts compiled and passed engine tests but did **not** sign/verify the completed
app bundle. The owner reported “damaged and can't be opened”; `codesign --verify` reported “code has no
resources but signature indicates they must be present.” Do not use those artifacts as launch-qualified builds.

Packaging now ad-hoc signs the completed `.app` and requires strict signature verification both before
archiving and after extraction. The embedded build report records the pre-bundle-signing binary hash; the
external `build-info.json` records the final signed executable hash, avoiding a self-referential resource seal.
Corrected run [37488722228](https://github.com/last-refuge/pipkin/actions/runs/37488722228) on clean
`91e1586000a1ed999d28b04fe9dbf4dcae316c83` passed both actual signature checks (“valid on disk” and
“satisfies its Designated Requirement”). That run fixed the signature defect; it did not include Pi/Node. For the newer self-contained build below,
extract a fresh app and replace the old bundle rather than merging files into it.
Ad-hoc signatures verify integrity, **not publisher identity or Gatekeeper acceptance**; Developer ID signing
and notarization remain absent.

Read-only checks on your extracted copy (use straight quotes, not smart quotes):

```sh
codesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose=4 "/absolute/path/Pipkin.app"
spctl --assess --type execute --verbose=4 "/absolute/path/Pipkin.app"
```

Do not disable Gatekeeper globally. A correct ad-hoc bundle may still be refused as unnotarized; that is a
separate trust/distribution gate, not something compilation or signature-integrity checks close.

## What is included

- `Pipkin.app`, with bundled UI assets, target-specific Rust dependency notices and exact source for
  identified MPL dependencies. Notice retention is not legal clearance.
- Source/binary/target identity and direct `otool -L` dependencies; this is not a complete native SBOM.
- Starting with clean `c91bbfe17e27d5f42ebceda9c0784d8bd5c93e6e`: the actual pinned Pi engine
  (`d2a311097cbcf669e699479587332ae3988a49d0`), immutable model snapshot, production npm dependencies
  with retained notices, and architecture-matched Node **22.23.3** with its full dependency LICENSE.
  Node/npm are not installed globally; the engine uses the app's private runtime, not Terminal's PATH.

Self-contained qualification: [37507592573](https://github.com/last-refuge/pipkin/actions/runs/37507592573).
Artifact: `pipkin-macos-ARM64-c91bbfe17e27d5f42ebceda9c0784d8bd5c93e6e`.
Archive SHA-256: `31c95536ce8e82c2c7d86faa15b4185029247dfce4d96294a8331a363cc46590`.
The native runner tested the staged bundled pair, then extracted the signed archive and ran its actual CLI
with a bare system PATH/private profile: Node 22.23.3, owned engine handshake **OK (1.9s)**. Strict signatures
passed before archive, after extraction and after engine startup. This is automated CLI/runtime evidence,
not observed Finder UI startup, publisher trust or provider login.

## Subscription onboarding build for owner evaluation

The OAuth-only onboarding implementation was built on macOS 15 (Apple Silicon) in [run 37559405162](https://github.com/last-refuge/pipkin/actions/runs/37559405162), clean commit `5fd4944f7a9a2be772dfe0d912677eed4c424bc7`. Download artifact `pipkin-macos-ARM64-5fd4944f7a9a2be772dfe0d912677eed4c424bc7`. Its experimental archive `pipkin-0.0.1-aarch64-apple-darwin-experimental.zip` has SHA-256 `5cc1367953d31471ebaf52f314dee4b798016bdd903a1583a7fb13bde66231a0`. This app includes the reviewed OAuth bridge in the bundled pinned Pi engine; CI passed its real local Unix-transport capability test, without using account credentials. The bundle is ad-hoc signed, **not** notarized; neither Finder launch nor live provider sign-in has been verified on a user's Mac. Use an isolated profile for first-run evaluation. Do not paste sign-in codes into logs or support reports.

## Experimental drag-to-Applications image

The first DMG run [37618114190](https://github.com/last-refuge/pipkin/actions/runs/37618114190)
**failed** after the image was created, mounted and copied: the copied app's signature and file
hashes passed, but its offline engine probe timed out after 45 seconds. The ZIP probe passed.
The DMG probe used a longer temporary profile prefix; the pinned Pi engine's longest internal
server socket path was 108 bytes in that run versus 104 for the successful ZIP probe, near or
above Darwin's Unix-socket limit. The log retained only the engine tail, not the bind syscall
error, so this is a strongly supported diagnosis, not direct bind-error evidence. Both probes
now use private short profiles and check Pi's *internal* socket-path budget before launching.
Corrected run [37624278297](https://github.com/last-refuge/pipkin/actions/runs/37624278297)
on clean `962fba3` **passed**: the ZIP and copied DMG app both passed strict signature checks and
offline engine probes (2.0s and 2.1s). The first failed run produced no downloadable DMG.
This pass predates the custom volume icon below, which requires another macOS run.

The packaging workflow now also builds `pipkin-<version>-<target>-experimental.dmg` from the **same
signed app** as the ZIP. The disk image contains `Pipkin.app`, a shortcut to `/Applications`,
and a hidden `.VolumeIcon.icns` made from Pipkin's supplied icon. Packaging sets the mounted
volume's custom-icon flag on a writable image before compressing it. The macOS runner then
mounts the final image read-only, checks the volume-icon bytes and Finder flag, copies the app
to a disposable destination, checks its signature and app/Node/icon hashes, and runs an offline
engine handshake from the copied app. The icon of the **downloaded `.dmg` file** is separate
Finder metadata, not established by this mounted-volume check or guaranteed by artifact upload.
`SHA256SUMS` lists both formats. The icon checks are newly implemented and **not yet a
passing remote result**; examine the run for the exact revision before relying on its artifact.
The owner observed a downloaded DMG launch on Mac, but GUI onboarding/provider acceptance remains open.

For an owner evaluation, download both the DMG and `SHA256SUMS` from one identified Actions
artifact, run `shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS` in their directory (the ZIP must also be present),
open the DMG in Finder, and drag **Pipkin.app** to **Applications**. Replace an earlier Pipkin.app
as a whole; do not merge its contents. Open the installed copy from Applications, not the mounted
image, and retain the app revision and macOS version with any observations. A checksum verifies
file identity against that artifact's report, **not the publisher**. This DMG is still ad-hoc
signed and unnotarized: it may be blocked by Gatekeeper. Do not disable Gatekeeper globally.
Developer ID signing, notarization, a quarantined-download walkthrough, Intel coverage and
interactive provider sign-in remain separate gates.

The initial CI checks the pure core, Unix transport (including kernel peer uid), macOS owned-process
identification and native compilation. It also checks owned engine startup/stop and one real
scripted-provider file-edit/history round trip. No paid/provider-authenticated request is required.
See the actual run logs: workflow existence alone is not a passing result.

## If an earlier Pipkin profile skips setup

Installing a new `.app` does **not** reset existing Pipkin projects, conversations or Pi
credentials. The owner observed a workspace with older sessions, an empty model list and an
outdated terminal-login instruction after opening a DMG-installed app. Saved work intentionally
opens the workspace rather than replaying the first-run welcome; that behavior alone does not
prove the package is damaged or that a model is connected. The old no-model instruction was wrong for
the bundled OAuth flow. A subsequent build offers **Connect account** in the no-model banner,
which opens Claude/ChatGPT setup in Pipkin without deleting saved work. That GUI fix still needs
owner macOS evaluation; it is not present in earlier downloaded DMGs. If the bundled engine
cannot offer OAuth, the banner reports that limitation instead of showing a dead sign-in action.

To evaluate the first-run wizard **with the currently installed app** while keeping the usual
profiles untouched, close Pipkin and launch an isolated one from Terminal:

```sh
scratch=$(mktemp -d /tmp/pk-XXXXXX)
PI_SERVER_DIR="$scratch/server" \
  "/Applications/Pipkin.app/Contents/MacOS/pipkin" \
  --pi-agent-dir "$scratch/agent" --data-dir "$scratch/app"
```

This uses a private scratch app database, server directory and Pi agent directory; it does not
repair the normal profile or remove any existing sessions. Do not share its logs without review.
If the app is installed in `~/Applications`, use that path instead. For everyday use, launch the
normal Applications copy without these overrides. Real provider sign-in and a first reply remain
owner tests.

## Launch for evaluation

To try the interface without an engine, use a disposable app data directory:

```sh
./Pipkin.app/Contents/MacOS/pipkin --demo normal --data-dir /private/tmp/pipkin-mac-demo
```

The demo is simulated, not an agent. The self-contained artifact requires **no Pi checkout, npm install,
system Node or manual server startup**. Real-mode engine/runtime evaluation can use a disposable app and
agent profile. The new first-run UI offers Claude Pro/Max and ChatGPT Plus/Pro OAuth only, and keeps Pi responsible for credential storage. Do not use personal credentials in unattended tests; interactive authorization and a first real reply still need owner observation.

For a disposable runtime evaluation (no credentials):

```sh
PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR=/private/tmp/pipkin-mac-eval-agent \
  ./Pipkin.app/Contents/MacOS/pipkin --data-dir /private/tmp/pipkin-mac-evaluation
```

The `--pi-repo`/`PIPKIN_ENGINE_DIR` override remains available for advanced development with a separately
prepared pinned checkout and compatible system Node. It is not required by the self-contained artifact.
Choose a disposable project and deliberately configure provider credentials if making real requests.
See [getting started](https://github.com/last-refuge/pipkin/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md),
[support/privacy](https://github.com/last-refuge/pipkin/blob/main/docs/support.md) and
[security reporting](https://github.com/last-refuge/pipkin/blob/main/SECURITY.md)
in the source repository; the app's resource folder retains SECURITY.md. Gatekeeper may refuse the
unnotarized artifact: this first pass does not claim normal end-user installation or trust acceptance.

## Port boundaries and next checks

macOS uses `getpeereid` rather than Linux `SO_PEERCRED`. Detached engine discovery uses kernel uid
and exact NUL-delimited environment entries, never `ps` text or name matching. Uninspectable processes
are not signal targets. The Linux stale-lock-removal optimization is deliberately disabled on macOS;
Pi retains responsibility for its stale-lock arbitration there.

Native Finder startup, provider authentication, Gatekeeper/notarization, clipboard-image capture,
Cmd-key conventions, IME/accessibility, sleep/wake and interactive process cleanup still need actual
Mac observation. External editor/terminal defaults remain Linux-oriented; configure explicit argument
arrays where needed. The storage default is still the existing XDG-style location, not yet macOS
Application Support. These limits are not silently waived by a successful build.

Windows work and the final 1.0 version/tag/publication are deferred until the macOS build is reviewed.
