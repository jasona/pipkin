# Bundled licenses and provenance audit

**Status: partial; not release clearance.** Generated inventories and copied license text are evidence, not a
substitute for reviewing missing notices, upstream applicability, or redistribution requirements.

## What packages carry

`usr/share/doc/pipkin/third-party/inventory.json` lists:

- The locked Linux Rust graph reachable from `pipkin-app` through normal/build edges. Cargo workspace feature
  unification can include extra feature dependencies, so this is a conservative inventory, not a minimal binary
  SBOM or proof of which functions were linked.
- Installed npm package roots and engine workspace packages actually in the staged tree. Workspace symlinks are
  resolved inside the engine; embedded `package.json` test fixtures are not treated as installed packages.
- Declared licenses, source identifiers, copied notice-file hashes and explicit review flags. Host cache paths are
  omitted. Ancestor/repository fallback notices are marked for applicability review.

Full package/vendored-component notice files are copied under `third-party/notices`. Pi's root MIT license and
existing font/icon notices remain in their normal package locations. The unmodified registry source for the
MPL-2.0 `option-ext` dependency is shipped under `third-party/sources/option-ext-0.2.0`; its inventory entry points to
that source. This source provision is specific to the current locked version, not a blanket claim about future MPL
changes. Source/update obligations must be rechecked when dependencies change.

For the current graph, the offered Apache-2.0 alternative is selected for Rust `self_cell`, and BSD-3-Clause for
npm `node-forge`. Their original notices are retained. Copying an optional GPL license text alongside an offered
permissive alternative does not mean Pipkin chose the GPL alternative. GPUI crates declare Apache-2.0; Zed's GPL
application crates are not imported merely because the source repository contains them.

## Initial findings (2026-10-06)

The first actual staged-tree inventory found **552 Rust** and **155 npm/workspace** entries. These counts include
conservatively overincluded feature/build dependencies and shipped example workspaces; they are not runtime-only
counts. All reachable Rust crates declare a license expression. Some published packages omit notice files despite
that declaration, and some npm packages omit the metadata license field.

Three npm packages (`buildcheck`, `cpu-features`, `ssh2`) have no metadata license declaration, but their installed
LICENSE files were inspected and contain the MIT grant and Brian White copyright. They remain flagged rather than
silently rewriting upstream metadata. `cpu-features` also carries a vendored component notice, which is retained.

Open findings include:

- Missing distributed notice files in several AWS SDK packages and other npm packages, including the platform
  esbuild binary package; validate applicable upstream notices and retain them with immutable provenance.
- Missing notice files in published Rust crates such as AccessKit, Lyon, profiling, pathfinder and others; use the
  package's published VCS revision to recover applicable upstream notices rather than copying a random current one.
- Confirm applicability of inherited notices for engine/workspace crates and source examples.
- Complete generated-provider-data provenance review (`packaging/engine-model-data.md`), asset provenance, external
  runtime dependency inventory, and any Apache NOTICE/source-offer requirements.

### Immutable notice recovery

`packaging/upstream-notices.json` records supplemental notice inputs with exact upstream commit URLs and SHA-256
hashes. The initial recovery obtained 33 notice files for 20 Rust package versions using the published crates'
`.cargo_vcs_info.json` revisions. Inventory generation verifies those hashes before copying the files. No network
fetch is needed during packaging. Recovered repository notices remain explicitly flagged for applicability review;
downloading a notice is not an automatic legal-clearance decision.

This reduced packages with no copied notice from 32 to 12, while the total review flags remain 59. Remaining
missing-notice cases initially included five Rust package versions and seven npm package versions.

A subsequent npm metadata review recovered the MIT notice for `@esbuild/linux-x64` 0.28.2 from its published
`gitHead`, and the MIT **libraries/LICENSE** notice for `standardwebhooks` 1.1.1 from its `gitHead`. The latter's
repository-root LICENSE is Apache-2.0 for the specification, not the JavaScript library's MIT license: do not
substitute that root text. These inputs retain immutable URLs/hashes and remain applicability-review flagged.
The current missing-notice count is **10 (five Rust, five npm)**, with **59 total review flags** unchanged.

The remaining AWS packages and `proxy-agent-negotiate` publish no `gitHead`; attempted version-tag lookup did not
provide corresponding AWS tags. The negotiate version's tag resolves to an exact commit with matching package
name/version but no package LICENSE, and no repository-root license. `data-uri-to-buffer`'s published commit also
has no notice file. Do not fabricate copyrights or copy an unrelated current license to make the list appear closed.

The inventory's `reviewRequired` entries are the machine-readable follow-up list. Do not mark the release-plan
license/provenance task complete until those findings are resolved or an explicit acceptable review decision is
recorded. Regenerate/review the inventory for every changed candidate; a prior snapshot is not clearance of a new
app/engine pair.

## Native/runtime inspection

Packages also carry `usr/share/doc/pipkin/runtime-inventory.json`, generated using **readelf without executing any
artifact**. It lists staged ELF hashes/machines, direct NEEDED shared-library names and referenced GLIBC/GLIBCXX/
CXXABI versions, plus non-ELF `.node` files. It flags foreign architectures/formats without pretending those are
supported runtimes. This is evidence, not a complete static/dlopen/linked-component SBOM or legal clearance.

The initial local scan found 33 native artifacts (including build object files), with seven foreign-format/architecture
flags. Pi's full source/dependency tree includes ARM, Darwin and Windows artifacts; their presence does not extend
Pipkin's supported platform. The scan also exposes optional sandbox/VM components, C++ runtime dependencies and
bundled `libkrun` depending on `libcap-ng`; these need applicability/licensing/runtime review in addition to npm
wrapper declarations. Do not infer that every optional dependency is exercised by the scripted-provider suite.

The actual locally built app references **GLIBC_2.44**. The package's ABI requirements depend on its build inputs;
this unsigned local artifact is not a promise of portability to older Linux systems. The final supported-platform
candidate needs its own ABI/runtime qualification. Node >=22.19 and the PKGBUILD's desktop/GPU dependencies remain
external runtime requirements. Rust/Go standard libraries and bundled native components also require provenance/
notice review beyond the Cargo/npm package graph.

## Reproduction

```sh
scripts/package.sh "$PI_CHECKOUT"  # includes inventory generation from locked metadata and the actual engine
python3 scripts/test-license-inventory.py
python3 scripts/test-runtime-inventory.py
```

Python 3 is a build/qualification dependency, not a new installed-app runtime dependency. The fixture test checks
notice retention, workspace-link handling, exclusion of embedded fixture manifests, MPL source provision and
omission of private host paths. No provider credentials or inference requests are involved.
